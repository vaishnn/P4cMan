# Package Manager Features

## Beginner Features: The Core Functionality

These are the essential features that any package manager must have. Start with these to build a solid foundation.

*   **List Installed Packages**: Display a list of all the Python packages currently installed in the user's environment. For each package, you should show at least its name and version.
*   **Search for Packages**: Implement a feature to search for packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI). Your GUI should have a search bar, and the results should be displayed in a clear and organized manner.
*   **Install Packages**: This is the most crucial feature. Allow users to install new packages from PyPI. Your GUI should provide a simple way to trigger the installation process.
*   **Uninstall Packages**: Provide a way for users to remove packages they no longer need.
*   **Show Package Details**: When a user selects a package, display more detailed information about it, such as the author, a short description, and its homepage.
*   **Basic GUI with wxWidgets**: Create a simple and intuitive graphical user interface that allows users to access all the features listed above.

## Intermediate Features: Enhancing the Workflow

Once you have the basics down, you can add these features to make your package manager more powerful and user-friendly.

*   **Upgrade Packages**: Allow users to upgrade their installed packages to the latest available versions. You could even add a feature to upgrade all packages at once.
*   **Virtual Environment Management**: This is a key feature for any serious Python developer. Allow users to create, delete, and switch between different virtual environments. This will help them manage dependencies for different projects without conflicts.
*   **Dependency Resolution**: When a user installs a package, your manager should automatically identify and install all of its dependencies.
*   **Requirements File Support**: Implement the ability to generate a `requirements.txt` file from the current environment and to install all the packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file. This is essential for creating reproducible environments.
*   **Package Version Specification**: Allow users to install a specific version of a package, not just the latest one.
*   **Enhanced GUI**:
    *   Add a dedicated panel or tab for managing virtual environments.
    *   Improve the package details view to show a list of dependencies.
    *   Include progress bars to give users feedback during package installation and downloads.
    *   Add a "Check for Updates" button to see which packages have newer versions available.

## Advanced Features: For Power Users and Professionals

These features will make your package manager stand out and demonstrate a deep understanding of the Python ecosystem.

*   **Advanced Dependency Conflict Resolution**: Implement a sophisticated algorithm to handle complex dependency conflicts. For example, if two packages require different versions of the same dependency, your manager should be able to identify the conflict and suggest a solution.
*   **Support for Different Package Sources**: Allow users to install packages from sources other than PyPI, such as a private company repository, a Git repository, or a local directory.
*   **Package Caching**: To speed up the installation process, you can cache downloaded packages so they don't have to be downloaded again if they are needed for another project.
*   **Security Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate with a security vulnerability database to scan the user's installed packages and warn them about any known security risks.
*   **Lock File Generation**: Create a "lock file" (similar to `poetry.lock` or `Pipfile.lock`) that records the exact versions of all installed packages and their dependencies. This ensures that the project can be re-created with the exact same environment on any machine.
*   **Dependency Graph Visualization**: Create a visual representation of the project's dependencies, showing how all the packages are interconnected.
*   **Advanced GUI Features**:
    *   A settings page where users can configure different package sources.
    *   A security report view to display any found vulnerabilities.
    *   An interface for creating and managing lock files.
