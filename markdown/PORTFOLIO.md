# About the Developer

This project, codenamed "PacMan," serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my software engineering capabilities. While the name is playful, the application itself is a sophisticated Python environment and package manager, showcasing a deep understanding of application architecture, user interface design, and system-level tooling.

This is not just a simple script; it is a well-structured, feature-rich desktop application that reflects a commitment to quality, scalability, and user experience.

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights proficiency across the full development lifecycle, from concept to a polished final product.

### 1. Advanced Python Development
The entire application is built on a solid foundation of modern Python. The codebase demonstrates a strong grasp of object-oriented principles, modular design, and the effective use of the standard library.

- **See:** The clean entry point in `main.py` and the separation of concerns throughout the directory structure.

### 2. Desktop GUI with PyQt6
A rich, responsive, and visually appealing user interface was built from the ground up using the powerful PyQt6 framework. This includes:
- Custom-styled widgets and a cohesive visual theme.
- A smooth onboarding experience for new users (`onboarding/`).
- Attention to detail, such as a custom splash screen and iconography (`assets/`).

- **See:** `pacman.py` for the main window logic and `ui/` for individual components.

### 3. Modern Application Architecture
The project is intentionally designed to be modular and maintainable. Configuration, application state, business logic, and UI are all decoupled, making the application easy to extend and debug.

- **Configuration:** Centralized YAML files (`config/`) drive application behavior, from UI dimensions to file paths.
- **State Management:** The application intelligently loads and persists its state (`helpers/state.py`).
- **Worker Threads:** Long-running tasks (e.g., finding interpreters, managing libraries) are handled in background workers (`workers/`) to keep the UI responsive.

### 4. System-Level Tooling
The core functionality revolves around managing Python environments, demonstrating skills that go beyond typical application development.

- **Environment Discovery:** The tool can locate Python interpreters and virtual environments on the local system (`workers/find_python_interepreaters.py`, `workers/find_virtual_env.py`).
- **Package Installation:** It features a robust library installer, even including Go components (`installer/`) for performance-critical operations, showcasing polyglot programming ability.

### 5. Attention to User Experience (UX)
The application is designed with the end-user in mind.
- **Onboarding:** A dedicated module (`onboarding/`) ensures a smooth first-time user experience.
- **Visual Feedback:** The UI provides clear feedback on application status.
- **Intuitive Design:** The overall layout and workflow are designed to be straightforward and efficient.

### 6. Web Integration
The presence of a `website/` directory (HTML, CSS, JS) indicates the ability to build and integrate web components as part of a larger project ecosystem.
